. üëã Hi,I'm Harika Eravathri
.  I'm Devops Engineer with 3 Years of Cloud Experience I work with AWS. I build and manage cloud infrastructure to make software delivery faster and more reliable. I use DevOps tools to help projects run 
   smoothly, scale well, and stay secure. I create CI/CD pipelines, automate deployments, and manage containers with Docker and Kubernetes. I aim to reduce downtime and improve development speed. I use 
   Terraform to set up cloud resources like VMs, App Services, EC2, S3, and Load Balancers. scanning tools like Sonar, Veracode, ECR scan.I also monitor performance with tools like CloudWatch, and Prometheus- 
   graphana, keeping applications running efficiently. I write scripts using Shell, Bash, and python to automate tasks, troubleshoot issues, and maintain 24/7 service availability. I follow best practices to 
   keep cloud environments safe and efficient.
